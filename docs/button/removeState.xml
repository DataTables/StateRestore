        This is used as one of the secondary buttons within the `-button stateRestore` split button that represents and provides functionality for a saved state. This button removes the relevant `-init stateRestore` instance. This completely removes the state from storage, as well as removing the buttons that represent it.

        A confirmation modal is shown when the button is pressed to confirm that this is what the user wants to do.
        
        There are 2 other secondary buttons also within the split button - `-button renameState` and `-button updateState`. Their documentation provides further details relevant to their functionality.

        This button is used within the `-init stateRestore` extension. It won't do anything if removing states is disabled using the `-init stateRestore.remove` initialisation option.

        This button does not have any extra configuration options that are not available by default. The text in the button can be set by using the `-init language.buttons.removeState` option.
