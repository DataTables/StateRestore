	<description>
This button extends the `-button savedStates` button to include the `-button createState` button in the collection that is normally displayed when the `-button savedStates` button is pressed.

As well as the `-button createState` button, the usual collection that contains a number of `-button stateRestore` buttons, one for each state that is being stored by `-init stateRestore`, is shown.

This button is deprecated as of version 1.1.1 and will be removed in a future release. It is now favoured to use the buttons `-init buttons.buttons` initialisation option to add the other buttons to the start of the collection.
