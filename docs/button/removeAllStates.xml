	<description>
        This button can be displayed at the top level alongside the `-button savedStates` and `-button createState` buttons. This button removes all `-init stateRestore` instances. This completely removes the states from storage, as well as removing the buttons that represent them.

        No confirmation modal is shown as default when using this button.
        
        This button is used within the `-init stateRestore` extension. It won't do anything if removing states is disabled using the `-init stateRestore.remove` initialisation option.

        This button does not have any extra configuration options that are not available by default. The text in the button can be set by using the `-init language.buttons.removeAllStates` option.
