        This is used as one of the secondary buttons within the `-button stateRestore` split button that represents and provides functionality for a saved state. This button renames the relevant `-init stateRestore` instance. This changes the text value that is displayed within the button for this state, and also the value that would be used to refer to it when using API methods.
        
        There are 2 other secondary buttons also within the split button - `-button removeState` and `-button updateState`. Their documentation provides further details relevant to their functionality.

        This button is used within the `-init stateRestore` extension. It won't do anything if renaming is disabled using the `-init stateRestore.renameSate` initialisation option.

        This button does not have any extra configuration options that are not available by default. The text in the button can be set by using the `-init language.buttons.renameState` option.
