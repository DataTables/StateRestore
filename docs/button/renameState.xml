        This is used as one of the secondary buttons within the `-button stateRestore` split button that represents and provides functionality for a saved state. This button renames the relevant `-init stateRestore` instance. This changes the text value that is displayed within the button for this state, and also the value that would be used to refer to it when using api methods.
        
        There are 2 other secondary buttons also within the split button - `-button deleteState` and `-button saveState`. Their documentation provides further details relevant to their functionality.

        This button is used within the `-init stateRestore` extension.

    <option name="action" type="function">
        The action function for the StateRestore button loads the state that it represents into the table.
    </option>
    <option name="text" type="function">
        This function runs the `-api i18n()` function to decide the text value of the rename button. The value of this button can be set using the `-init i18n` initialisation options `buttons.renameState` property, or you could directly change the value of this function.
    </option>
