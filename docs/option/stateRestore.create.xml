		This option allows for the creation of states to be enabled or disabled.

		As default the value is `true`, meaning that states can be created. If this option is set to `false`, then creation will be disabled.

		It is also worth noting that if `-init stateRestore.save` is set to `false`, the value set here will be overruled. This is because creation is a form of saving, and is therefore disabled when that option is.

		Take a look at [this example](/extensions/StateRestore/examples/initialisation/noCreation.html) to see this in action.
