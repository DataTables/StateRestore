	<![CDATA[
This method provides the ability to retrieve details about all of the currently active states that are managed by the `-init stateRestore` extension.

The method is plural as it is possible to have multiple states that are active at the same time.

A Datatables API is returned containing all of the active states as objects. Each object contains the following properties.

* `name` - The name of the state.
* `data` - The data that is used to implement the state.
