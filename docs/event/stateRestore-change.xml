		<description>Triggered when a StateRestore state has been added, removed or changed.</description>
	</type>

	<description>
This event is triggered whenever one of the following occurs to a state within StateRestore.

* A new state is added
* A state is removed
* A state is renamed.
* A state is updated

This has several uses, but the main one for us is to update labels that include which state is currently active. You can see this in action in [this example](//datatables.net/extensions/StateRestore/examples/customisation/activeLabel.html).

The event is triggered on the original table element.

		for (var i = 1; i < active.length; i++) {

		}
	}
	else {
		activeString += 'No active state';
	}
